# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Rust Learning Group 
ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ ðŸ“–

This is the Home for the Rust Learning Group - the group will organize meetings, workshops and online streams here and share information about their learnings.   

## Where can I join the learning group?
Get in touch with the group via the [IOTA Discord](http://discord.iota.org) in the #rust channel. A group member will get in contact with you!

For German speakers, we have the same process in the [einfachIOTA Discord](https://discord.gg/WdfXseU). Just write in the #rust channel in the development category.


## Why Rust?
Since Coordicide is on the Roadmap, things becoming clearer for the IOTA community: The IOTA Foundation is focusing on Rust, a programming language for Web and IoT.

Rust is a [multi-paradigm programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) focused on performance and [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety). Itâ€™s developed by Mozilla and backed up with [sponsoring by big players](https://www.rust-lang.org/sponsors) like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Here is a [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/production/users) with some companies which use Rust in production with different uses cases. These use cases are very diverse, for example, Atlassian use Rust in service for analyzing petabytes of their source code and Cloudflare uses it as a replacement for memory-unsafe languages (particularly C) and is using it in their core edge logic.


## How to contribute
Just fork the repo, make your changes and create a pull request. 
Don't know how it works? No problem, this video explains it:
