# Introduction
Daniel works at the IOTA Foundation as Senior Architect in the Engineering department. In this role, Daniel is focused on hardening the security posture of the IOTA ecosystem and designing the next generation of wallets. His main project is “Stronghold” - an advanced system for protecting private keys and seeds.

He is also a champion for open source and contributes to a number of projects, most notably as core-member of the open source project [Tauri](https://tauri.studio), which is a framework for building smaller, faster and more secure native applications using Rust and Webtech.

## When and how did you learn Rust? 
I started learning Rust about a year ago while working on Tauri. I followed some video tutorials, completed the rustlings course and have the amazing opportunity to work with professionals.

## What is currently fascinating you on Rust?
Using rust as a single source of code truth in order to make its artifacts / libraries consumable by any other programming language.

## What would you do better - if you had to learn Rust again?
Spend more time learning about unsafe rust. It’s really powerful and not as scary as it sounds. Still dangerous, but I wouldn’t have just merely ignored it from the beginning.
